## Sign Up

Sign up for your Pazemo account, activate your account, and complete verification.
Using the product before integrating with our API will help you understand how our payment flow works. Just follow these four steps

- Sign up for your Pazemo account https://pazemo.com/signup.

- Complete verification – you need to do this before you start your technical integration. Also ensure you’re compliant with our Terms and Conditions and Acceptable Use Policy. Also make sure two-step log in is set up.

- Activate at least one currency in your multi-currency account, deposit small amount (via card or bank transfer) and setup your first payment. This penny-testing is not mandatory of course, but we do recommended it so you will understand how Pazemo payment flow works.

- Verify that our coverage includes your currency route(s). Check Supported Currencies. Please note that there are few restrictions for businesses, please review Restricted Business Routes

- Please note that our Fixed Rate functionality is intended to provide time for customers to send funds to Pazemo, while holding the rate for them. Pazemo is not a trading platform and the Fixed Rate functionality is automatically disabled if abusive behaviour (such as multiple transfer creation and selective completion) is detected.

## Choose the best tool for you

- You don’t necessarily need to integrate with the API to make a large number of withdraws. We have two ways you can do it:

- Batch payments. Create and send up to 1,000 transfers with just one payment using our Batch Payments tool. All you need to do is fill a CSV file with all the transfer details, upload it to Pazemo, and pay for the batch. No development effort needed.

- API integration. Completely automate your payment process by sending payment orders via the Pazemo Platform API.
